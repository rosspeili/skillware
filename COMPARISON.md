# Comparison: Skillware vs. Alternatives

Skillware is a Python framework that decouples AI tool logic, cognition, and governance into self-contained, installable modules called **Skills**.

This document clarifies how Skillware compares to other common approaches for equipping AI agents with tools, specifically focusing on **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, **Anthropic Skills**, and **Antigravity Skills**.

## 1. Skillware vs. Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) (MCP) is an open standard that connects AI models to data sources and tools via a client-server architecture.

### Key Differences
*   **Architecture**: MCP operates on a **Client-Server** model (using JSON-RPC over stdio or SSE). This requires running and managing separate servers for your tools. Skillware is **Python-Native**. It operates entirely within the Python runtime via library imports (`SkillLoader`). There is no network overhead or need to deploy external servers.
*   **Deployment Complexity**: MCP is powerful for language-agnostic, distributed systems but introduces significant infrastructure overhead. Skillware is designed for direct embedding into GenAI application pipelines, making it trivial to deploy.

## 2. Skillware vs. Anthropic Skills

[Anthropic's Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) repository provides reference tool implementations and prompts optimized specifically for Claude.

### Key Differences
*   **Model Agnosticism**: Anthropic skills are hardcoded for Claude's specific tool-calling schemas. Skillware features **Universal Adapters**. You write a single `manifest.yaml`, and Skillware's `SkillLoader` translates it dynamically at runtime to fit Gemini, Claude, or OpenAI formats natively.
*   **The "Managed" Runtime**: Anthropic provides standalone reference scripts. Skillware provides a comprehensive framework (`base_skill.py` and `loader.py`) that handles lifecycle, dynamic dependency checking, execution, and error handling automatically.

## 3. Skillware vs. Antigravity ("Agentic" Skills)

Frameworks like Google DeepMind's **Antigravity** use `SKILL.md` files to provide context to an autonomous coding agent working inside an IDE.

### Key Differences
*   **Target Audience**:
    *   **Antigravity Skills** provide **Procedural Memory** ("How to run this repository's build script") for a **Developer Agent** writing code.
    *   **Skillware** provides **Functional Capabilities** (executable Python logic like "Check this crypto wallet") for the **Runtime Agent** (the end-user application).

## The Token Economy Advantage

A critical architectural distinction is how Skillware treats logic execution versus "code generation."

*   **The Code-Generation Approach**: Many platforms prompt the LLM to write code on the fly to solve a requested problem. This is expensive (you pay for output tokens every time), slow, and risky (the LLM executes unreviewed code).
*   **The Skillware Approach**: Skillware relies on **Pre-Compiled Logic**. The LLM decides *which* tool to call (e.g., wallet_screening) and passes arguments. The heavy lifting happens deterministically in the Python `BaseSkill` implementation. This results in **zero-cost logic execution**, instant processing, and static, auditable code boundaries.
